# AGENT GUIDELINES

## Process Rules

1. Always update development-notes/PROJECT_STATUS.md as the final step of any activity.
2. Never modify specifications/SPEC.md without explicitly listing changes.
3. Do not introduce new dependencies without justification.
4. Prefer modifying existing modules over creating new ones.
5. Stop at review gates and await human approval.
